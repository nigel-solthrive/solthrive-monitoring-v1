**A1 — Current Transformer (CT) Specifications**

**SolThrive Monitoring V1 — Enhanced Engineering Edition**

---

## **1. Purpose**

This document defines all **technical requirements, installation guidelines, electrical behavior, and safety considerations** for the Current Transformers (CTs) used in SolThrive Monitoring V1.

CTs are responsible for measuring:

* **Home consumption**
* **Solar PV production**
* **Grid import/export**
* **Real-time power flow (W, kW)**

This is one of the most critical hardware sections of the entire monitoring system.

---

## **2. What CTs Actually Do (Plain English)**

A CT clamps around **one conductor** and senses the magnetic field generated by electrical current flowing through it.

Think of it as:

> **“A stethoscope for electricity.”**
> Non-contact, non-invasive, no cutting wires.

---

## **3. CT Types — Which Style SolThrive Uses**

### **Split-Core CTs (Recommended for V1)**

* Clamp-on
* Fast retrofit installation
* No wire disconnection
* Very safe
* Slight accuracy tradeoff vs solid-core

**SolThrive V1 standard = 100% split-core CTs.**

### **Solid-Core CTs**

* Require removing the conductor
* Highest accuracy
* Not suitable for residential retrofit installs

Used only in specialized V2 commercial deployments.

## **4. Required CT Amp Ratings**

| CT Location             | Required Rating | Reason                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Main Service L1**     | 100–200A        | Full home load                  |
| **Main Service L2**     | 100–200A        | Same as above                   |
| **PV Backfeed Breaker** | 20–50A          | Inverter output is much smaller |

**Summary:**

> **(2) 100–200A CTs** for mains
> **(1) 20–50A CT** for PV

This ensures the meter has the correct dynamic range.

## **5. CT Polarity & Orientation (Critical!)**

Each CT has a printed arrow.
The arrow indicates **direction of current flow** the meter expects.

### **Correct Orientation**

* **Main CTs → arrow toward the home (toward loads)**
* **PV CT → arrow toward the inverter (toward source)**

### If reversed:

* Import/export polarity flips
* Solar may show as negative
* Fixable in software, but best to avoid

---

## **6. CT Wiring & Terminal Mapping**

Most split-core CTs used in V1 have two leads:

* **White = +**
* **Black = –**

### **Meter Terminal Mapping**

* CT1 → **I1+ / I1–**
* CT2 → **I2+ / I2–**
* CT3 → **I3+ / I3–**

Maintain color consistency to avoid phase inversion errors.

---

## **7. Accuracy Requirements**

CT Accuracy Class options:

* **1% — Ideal (V1 standard)**
* **0.5% — Premium**
* **3% — Too low for meaningful monitoring**

**SolThrive V1 target: 1% split-core CTs with built-in burden resistors.**

---

## **8. Burden Resistor Requirements**

CTs **must** have burden resistors to safely convert the magnetic signal into measurable voltage.

### **V1 Requirement**

* Use CTs **with built-in burden resistors**

### Benefits:

* Safer
* Meter-ready
* No chance of dangerous open-circuit voltage
* Cleaner wiring

Never operate a CT with the secondary open while current is flowing.

---

## **9. Field Safety Notes (Required Reading)**

* Clamp around **only one** conductor
* Never clamp hot + neutral together
* Avoid energized lugs
* Shut off main breaker if uncertain
* Treat panels as energized even when they appear off
* Keep hands clear of bus bars

Safety is non-negotiable — CT installation must be deliberate and careful.

## **12. Summary for Installers**

To meet SolThrive V1 requirements:

✔ (2) **100–200A split-core CTs** for the mains
✔ (1) **20–50A split-core CT** for the PV backfeed
✔ **All CTs must include built-in burden resistors**
✔ Accuracy target: **1%**
