# SolThrive Monitoring V1 — Extended Engineering Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of electrical, solar, networking, monitoring, and software terms used throughout the SolThrive Monitoring V1 project. Definitions are written in clear language and explain why each term matters to your system.

# 1. Electrical Concepts

### **Voltage (V)**
Electric “pressure” that pushes current through a circuit.  
Matters because the meter measures L1/L2 voltage to calculate power.

### **Current (A)**
Flow of electricity through a conductor.  
Measured by CTs to determine how much power a system is using or generating.

### **Power (W / kW)**
Instantaneous energy usage or production. Calculated as:  
**Power = Voltage × Current**

### **Energy (kWh)**
Total amount of electricity consumed or produced over time.  
Used for billing and long-term system tracking.

### **Split-phase (120/240V)**
Standard U.S. residential electrical system with L1, L2, and neutral.

### **Power Factor (PF)**
How “efficiently” current is being converted into useful power.  
Ranges from 0 to 1.0.  
Solar inverters usually have a PF near 1.0.

### **Reactive Power (VAR)**
Non-working power caused by motors/transformers.  
Not needed for V1 but important for advanced monitoring.

### **Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)**
Measurement of electrical “noise” or distortion.  
Relevant for V2/V3 power quality features.

### **Neutral Current**
Current returning through the neutral conductor.  
Not measured in V1 but relevant in advanced metering.

### **Backfeed Breaker**
The breaker where the inverter feeds power into the main panel.  
Your PV CT wraps around this conductor.

### **Service Entrance**
Where utility power enters the home.  
Main CTs wrap around L1/L2 here.

### **Burden Resistor**
A resistor that safely converts CT output into measurable voltage.  
Required for CTs — V1 uses CTs with built-in burdens.

# 2. Solar Monitoring Terms

### **Production**
Power being generated by the solar array (PV system).

### **Consumption**
Power used by the home’s appliances.

### **Import**
Power drawn *from* the grid when the home needs more energy than solar provides.

### **Export**
Excess solar sent *to* the grid.

### **Net Metering**
Utility billing method where exported power offsets imported power.

### **Aggregate Power**
Total power flow at a specific point (e.g., total home load).

### **PV Array**
The collection of solar panels wired together.

### **Optimizer**
A device attached to each panel to maximize output and provide panel-level data.

### **Panel-Level Monitoring**
Monitoring at individual panel resolution (OEM feature, not V1 universal).

### **Inverter Telemetry**
Data made available from the inverter (OEM monitoring only).

# 3. Hardware & Field Components

### **CT (Current Transformer)**
Clamp-on sensor used to measure electrical current.  
SolThrive V1 uses 3 CTs:
- Main L1  
- Main L2  
- PV breaker  

### **Split-Core CT**
CT that opens/closes around a conductor.  
Ideal for retrofit installs.

### **Solid-Core CT**
CT without a hinge — requires conductor to be removed.  
More accurate but not practical for V1.

### **Polarity Arrow**
Printed arrow on the CT indicating the direction of current flow.  
Critical for correct readings.

### **Termination Resistor (120Ω)**
Used at the ends of RS-485 lines for signal integrity.

### **RS-485**
Wiring standard used for industrial communication over long distances.  
Carries Modbus RTU in SolThrive V1.

### **Modbus RTU**
The protocol used by the meter so the Pi can read registers.

### **DIN Rail**
Mounting rail used in electrical enclosures.  
Used for meter + (optional) Pi mount.

### **Enclosure**
Protective box for electrical hardware.

### **Ferrules**
Metal sleeves crimped onto stranded wire for secure screw-terminal connections.

# 4. Software & Data Terms

### **JSON**
A structured data format:
```

{ "voltage_l1": 241.2, "current_l1": 14.5 }

```
Used for the latest snapshot.

### **JSONL (JSON Lines)**
One JSON object per line — perfect for logs:
```

{"x":1}
{"x":2}
{"x":3}

```

### **CSV**
Comma-separated values file — easy for Excel, analytics, and charts.

### **API Endpoint**
URL path that returns data (e.g., `/api/latest`).

### **REST API**
A simple web API that responds to HTTP GET requests.

### **WebSocket**
Real-time streaming data channel (V2 feature).

### **Poller**
Service that reads Modbus registers and outputs JSON.

### **Logger**
Service that stores data efficiently.

### **Daemon**
Background service running continuously.

### **Systemd Service**
Linux service that:
- starts at boot  
- restarts on crash  
- maintains reliability  

Used for poller, logger, and API.

### **Timeseries Data**
Data indexed by timestamp — ideal for energy monitoring.

### **Sampling Interval**
How frequently the poller grabs new readings (1–5 seconds).

# 5. Networking Terms

### **LAN (Local Area Network)**
Home network where the Pi and router live.

### **Ethernet**
Hardwired network connection — most stable for monitoring.

### **Wi-Fi**
Wireless connection — easier but less stable than Ethernet.

### **DHCP**
Router automatically assigns an IP address.

### **Static IP**
Fixed IP address assigned manually — ideal for future commercial installs.

### **Port**
A “door” on a device used for network communication (e.g., port 8080 for API).

### **Latency**
Delay between sending a request and receiving data.

### **TCP vs UDP**
Two network protocols.  
TCP = reliable, ordered (used for API).  
UDP = fast, no guaranteed delivery.

# 6. Raspberry Pi Concepts

### **GPIO**
General-purpose input/output pins (unused in V1).

### **UART**
Serial communication interface.  
RS-485 adapters often use UART → USB.

### **Serial Port**
Device file such as `/dev/ttyUSB0` used for Modbus communication.

### **System Logs**
Linux logs that record service activity.

### **Cron Job**
Scheduled task — not used in V1 but common in other Pi projects.

### **Restart Policy**
Defines what happens if a service crashes (systemd auto-restart).

---

# 7. Advanced Concepts (Future V2 / V3)

### **Edge Computing**
Processing data locally rather than in the cloud.  
SolThrive V1 is fully edge-based.

### **Cloud Sync**
Uploading summarized data to the cloud (V2/V3 feature).

### **Firmware Update**
Ability to push software updates to the Pi without accessing it manually.

### **Fleet Monitoring**
Monitoring many systems centrally (commercial V3 feature).

### **Load Disaggregation**
Using machine learning to identify appliances from energy signatures.

### **Anomaly Detection**
Automatically detecting abnormal consumption or inverter failures.
